My first, cool concept for the conveyor belt fell through. It was just not practical to complete for any sizeable model (although, I did get it working on the prototype - yippee!) So, here is the not nearly so cool version that I'm going for now.

It really does show the scale of the factory building... which is exactly what I was going for. Sadly, it also means that I have a ton of stuff to put in there to make it look conceivable. Just a basic material is used for the conveyor so far.
