Yes, we can't seem to focus on a single project. Last time I blogged we were still working on the factory scene with an rpg like feel. Now, we have changed direction and have started working on a robot game.

Chris has a wonderful story idea, that I will allow him to reveal in his time, but we are trying to start out in a junkyard with our main character. Creating the junkyard has proven very difficult... still I think we're making progress.

Here are some of the things I've been working on:
