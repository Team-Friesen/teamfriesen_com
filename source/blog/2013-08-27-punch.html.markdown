Just a bit of animation and rigging yesterday. Chris requested a punching animation, so I got down to working on that. In the process, I added to the rig to make creating a fist a lot easier. First I added a copy rotation constraint to each subsequent finger bone so that I would only need to move the first joint to bend the entire finger. Then I added a 'make fist' bone. I created an action with all the fingers wide open to closed in a fist, then added an action constraint, using the 'make fist' bone's Y-scale as the controller.

Thus, a quick sketch of a jab with fists closed came about. I baked it to a seperate action and applied it to the deformation rig.

I'll be working on cleaning up and elaborating animations the rest of this week, is my guess.
