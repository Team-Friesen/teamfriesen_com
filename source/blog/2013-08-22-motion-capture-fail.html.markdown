So, the daily blog almost stayed consistent. I had a busy weekend, with an accompaniment gig, and a band concert. Then I got my club yarn on Monday... our new bed arrived on Tuesday... and Chris' new, envy-worthy video card came just today! Been a busy week.

I finally got back to game stuff yesterday after a general mind block as to what to do next. Not much accomplished, but I did get the Factory split into levels for ease of use later on. Also, I did a little experimenting with motion capture. Not as in capturing my motions, but just exporting the actions from one character and importing them and applying them to another character. My results: not so good... :(
