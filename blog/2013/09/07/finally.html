The saga of import/export hell has finally been cleared and we've been brought into the heavenly light of a workflow that seems to be working.</p> <p>Static models have been exporting/importing fine. The trouble is the animated models. We've been working with the fairly simple enemy soldier model to find the best way to go about export/import workflow.</p> <p>Blender's fbx exporter consistently gave us nothing to import. The collada export also gave us nothing to import. Obj's obviously gave us great static models, but no animations. We recently tried a plugin specifically for exporting to Urho… which worked to a point. The mesh was fine, the skeleton was fine, the animations were fine… but the weight painting was totally borked.</p> <p>Today, I finally did a crazy test. I downloaded the trial version of Maya, and imported the enemy soldier and used the Maya fbx exporter. Imported into Urho with COMPLETE SUCCESS!!! Let me tell you that was a wonderful and troubling moment. It worked. But why!?!</p> <p>With this information under our belt, we had new search terms to work with. We discovered the <a href="//usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?id=10775855&amp;siteID=123112">Autodesk FBX Converter</a> which is a free tool that works. Now this seemed to be working for everything except for one annoyance. The mesh would end up having a 90 degree rotation offset from the skeleton. Perhaps we'll find an elegant way to solve this eventually, but having figured out the problem, I just brute forced the fix.</p> <p>Thus! Official export/import workflow is as follows:</p> <ul> <li>create model</li> <li>create animation on animation rig</li> <li>bake action so that it works on deformation rig</li> <li>weight paint</li> <li>in the weight paint tools, be sure to click Limit Total and set to 4</li> <li>select mesh in object mode, rotate 90 degrees on x-axis</li> <li>press ctrl-a and apply rotations</li> <li>select mesh, then export as fbx with following options: <ul> <li>check 'selected objects'</li> <li>scale: 1.00 (default)</li> <li>Forward: -Z forward</li> <li>Up: Y up</li> <li>blue highlighted Armatures and Meshes</li> <li>check 'apply modifiers'</li> <li>smoothing: Off</li> <li>check 'include animation'</li> <li>check 'include default take' (haven't tried all actions yet)</li> <li>check 'batch own dir' (default)</li> </ul> </li> <li>add the resulting .fbx to the fbx converter and convert using the 2013 version</li> <li>open the urho editor</li> <li>import fbx</li> <li>delete static model</li> <li>create animated model</li> <li>edit animated model to point at new model.xml</li> <li>change animation takes to 1 and point to model_animation_takes.ani</li> <li>test it!</li> <li>add the rest of the required bits to make your animated model usable and save the node</li> </ul> <p>Poo. That seems exhausting! LOL. Way less exhausting than several weeks of unsuccessful trials. Counting my blessings and looking forward to a good night sleep.</p> <p>Oh right. Picture for proof!</p> <p><img alt="static and animated models in engine" src="/files/factory_soldier_animation.png"/></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="main container"> <div class="footer row"> <div class=span4> <h3>contact team friesen:</h3> </div> <div class=span3> <h5>chris friesen</h5> game programming<br/> <a href="//github.com/friesencr/">github.com/friesencr</a><br/> <a href="//twitter.com/chris__man">@chris__man</a> </div> <div class=span5> <h5>marie friesen</h5> 3d modeling, rigging, animating<br/> <a href="//twitter.com/misspianoforte">@misspianoforte</a> </div> </div> </div> <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script> <script src="/javascripts/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script>
