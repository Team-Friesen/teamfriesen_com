Yes, we would simply say things like, "…and then the hero guy will go after the big bad guy to some town or other…" Now, we are finally trying to establish a setting and make some decisions that we will stick with.</p> <p>For instance, we've been sticking pretty close to the idea that the game will begin in a mine (newb zone, which will be skippable), and the real story will start in an industrial sort of town (level 1 zone). Knowing this, I have started to work on the industrial town, via a factory.</p> <p>Now, neither Chris or I are artists, which means that coming up with ideas are a bit tedius as I need to model/semi-texture/light every idea that we want to try. Thankfully, the factory seems to have made it through the initial idea stage without too many hitches.</p> <p><img alt="factory exterior" title="factory exterior" src="/files/galleries/environments/factory_01.png"/></p> <p><img alt="factory interior" title="factory interior" src="/files/galleries/environments/factory_03.png"/></p> <p>It's still bare bones at this point, but little by little I'm working my way through some smaller assets. I also started working on a robot that will be the main enemy throughout the factory scenes.</p> <p><img alt=robot title="robot in progress" src="/files/robot.png"/></p> <p>Obviously not finished yet, but you can probably get the gist of where I'm going with it.</p> <p>And lastly, I started working on a conveyor belt yesterday that ended semi-miserabely. After attempting to rig up the in-scale version of it that will be running the entire length of the wall of the factory (some 70 blender units), I realised I should probably prototype it, or redesign it to work in chunks, as the full length one crashed blender. (oops). So, I started on a super simple prototype, and didn't quite make it to fully-working completion.</p> <p><img alt="conveyor progress" title="conveyor progress" src="/files/conveyor_progress.jpg"/></p> <p>The rig by itself works fine. The cog spins nicely with the rig. And the belt works not at all.</p> <p>This will be what I will be working to complete today.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="main container"> <div class="footer row"> <div class=span4> <h3>contact team friesen:</h3> </div> <div class=span3> <h5>chris friesen</h5> game programming<br/> <a href="//github.com/friesencr/">github.com/friesencr</a><br/> <a href="//twitter.com/chris__man">@chris__man</a> </div> <div class=span5> <h5>marie friesen</h5> 3d modeling, rigging, animating<br/> <a href="//twitter.com/misspianoforte">@misspianoforte</a> </div> </div> </div> <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script> <script src="/javascripts/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <script>
